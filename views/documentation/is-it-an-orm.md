Is it an ORM?
=============
Contain is **NOT** an ORM. The project's philosophy is to give you all the advantages of a 
rich data model you typically get from an ORM without the need for an ORM. This makes
Contain ideal for projects:

* Performance is of the utmost importance (ORMs can be expensive, see: [Performance](/documentation/performance))
* Have little CRUD and are read/join heavy

That being said, there are ORMs available for Contain. It's even possible to integrate
Contain models with an ORM like Doctrine2.
